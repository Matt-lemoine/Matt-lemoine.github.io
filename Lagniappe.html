    <h1>Lagniappe</h1>

    <p>
        Lagniappe (pronounced: LAN-yap) is a Cajun French word meaning "a little extra". 
        I believe that as mathematicians, we should find little ways to give back to and get involved in our communities (local and mathematical) because of the opportunities that have been given us. 
        This page is dedicated to the ways that I am getting involved in and giving a little extra back to my community.

    <h2>Professional Service</h2>

    <h3><i>Math ACT Prep Workshop (December 2024 - present)</i></h3>
    <p>
        Each month, I go to the public library in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and help high school students study for the Math portion of the ACT. 
        This was a program I started as a way to help high school students learn how to study and to help grad students get into volunteering in the community.

    <h3><i>Mental Health Ally</i></h3>
    <p>
        I have and will always be a mental health ally. 
        As a mental health ally, I am available to anyone who needs someone to talk to or needs help managing their stress, anxiety, and depression.
