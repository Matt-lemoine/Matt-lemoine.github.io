    <h1> Research </h1>

    <p>
        My current research areas are primarily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis" target = "_blank">Topological Data Analysis (TDA)</a> and Low-Dimensional Topology. 
        In addition to these areas, I also find myself looking into areas of Statistics, Machine Learning (specifically Semi-Supervised Machine Learning), 
        Topological Deep Learning (TDL), and Computer Science.

    <h2>Talks</h2>
    <p>
        Below are talks that I have given. I have included the titles, abstracts, and where these talks were given along with the context that these talks were given.
        <ol reversed>
            <li>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><i><b>"Sliding Window Embedding"</b></i><br>
                <ins>Abstract:</ins> When we are looking at a dataset that has a time-dependency and is periodic (or quasi-periodic), we are interested in noticing differences in the period. 
                Using sliding window embeddings (also known as time-delay reconstructions), we can look at the periods of a given dataset and analyze the persistent homology to detect changes in our periods. 
                In this talk, we will be discussing the foundational paper in this area of Topological Data Analysis by Jose Perea and John Harer (arxiv:1307.6188v2). </p>
                At Lousisiana State University for the Informal Geometry and Topology Seminar (February 4, 2026)
            </li>
            <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><i><b>"An Introduction to Topological Data Analysis with an Application"</b></i>
                <br>
                <ins>Abstract:</ins> In this talk, we will look at a thorough introduction to Topological Data Analysis and the tools that are used most frequently in this field. 
                Then we will look at some work on a dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzing mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
                We will look specifically at two regions during this time ('The Northeast' and 'The South') following "Topological Data Analysis of Mortality Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic". 
                This paper is joint work with Megan Fairchild. This talk is aimed at being accessible to undergraduate students interested in Topology and Data Analysis.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><i><b>"Topological Data Analysis of Mortality Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic (joint work with M. Fairchild)"</b></i><br>
                <ins>Abstract:</ins> This talk will be a brief overview of Topological Data Analysis and will go into some of the work that Megan and I have done. 
                Topological Data Analysis is a relatively new field of study that uses topological invariants to study the shape of data. 
                We analyze a dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) using persistent homology and MAPPER. 
                This dataset tracks mortality week-to-week from January 2020 to September 2023 in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                We examine the dataset as a whole and break the United States into geographic regions to analyze the overall shape of the data. 
                Then, to explain this shape, we discuss events around the time of the pandemic and how they contribute to the observed patterns.</p>

    <h2>Funding and Grants</h2>
    <p>
        While at Louisiana State University, I have been primarily funded by Graduate Teaching Assistantships which include teaching, grading, and aiding different classes (See <a href="Teaching.html">'Teaching'</a> for more details on what I have taught, and classes I have aided and graded.)
        <br>
        During the 2025-2026 school year at Louisiana State University, I have been on the Research Training Groups (RTG) Grant, which allowed me to work more on my research and not have teaching duties.
