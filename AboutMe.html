    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I am from the Alexandria, Louisiana region (locally called CenLa, short for Central Louisiana). 
        I graduated from Grace Christian High School in 2019. Then I went to Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana, where I graduated magna cum laude in Spring 2022 with my Bachelors of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Actuarial Science. 
        I received my Masters of Science in Math from Louisiana State University in Fall 2024 and am still at LSU working to get my doctorate in Math. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I love learning new things, which motivates many of my hobbies and interests. 
        In addition to learning mathematics, I enjoy learning foreign languages. 
        I enjoy cooking and baking with friends and family. 
        I spend time practicing piano, reading, running, and drinking coffee. 
        Other hobbies that I enjoy include watching classic movies, sewing, crocheting, and traveling. 
        My favorite genres of music are Classical Piano and Today's Top Hits.
