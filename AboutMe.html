<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h1>

<p style="margin-bottom: -5px;">
    I am from the Alexandria, Louisiana region (locally called CenLa, short for Central Louisiana). 
    I graduated from Grace Christian High School in 2019. Then I went to Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Louisiana, where I graduated magna cum laude in Spring 2022 with my Bachelors of Science in Mathematics with a minor in Actuarial Science. 
    I received my Masters of Science in Math from Louisiana State University in Fall 2024 and am still at LSU working to get my doctorate in Math. 
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -5px;">
    I love learning new things, which motivates many of my hobbies and interests. 
    In addition to learning mathematics, I enjoy learning foreign languages. 
    I enjoy cooking and baking with friends and family. 
    I spend time practicing piano, reading, running, and drinking coffee. 
    Other hobbies that I enjoy include watching classic movies, sewing, crocheting, and traveling. 
    My favorite genres of music are Classical Piano and Today's Top Hits (specifically Beyoncé).
